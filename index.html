        <p>I wish I could eat the salt off of your lost faded lips
            We can cap the old times make playing only logical harm
            We can cap the old lines clay-making that nothing else will change
            But she can read, she can read, she can read, she can read, she's bad
            Oh, she's bad
            It's different now that I'm poor and aging, I'll never seek this face again
            You'll go stabbing yourself in the neck
            And we can find new ways of living make playing only logical harm
            And we can top the old times, clay-making that nothing else will change
            But she can read, she can read, she can read, she can read, she's bad
            She can read, she can read, she can read
            Oh, she's bad
            It's different now that I'm poor and aging, I'll never see this place again
            You go stabbing yourself in the neck
            But it's different now that I'm poor and aging, I'll never see this place again
            And you go stabbing yourself in the neck
            It's in the way that she pulls it
            It's in the things that she puts in my head
            Her stories are boring and stuff
            She's always calling my bluff
            She puts the, she puts the weights into my little heart
            And she gets in my room and she takes it apart
            She puts the weights into my little heart
            I said she puts the weights into my little heart
            She packs it away
            She packs it away
            She packs it away
            She packs it away
            She packs it away
            She packs it away
            She packs it away
            It's in the way that she walks
            Her heaven is never enough
            She puts the weights in my heart
            She puts, oh she puts the weights into my little heart
